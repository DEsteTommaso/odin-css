# Project Title

## Introduction

I created a fully functional web page based on a provided design using HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to apply my skills in building a complete webpage from scratch while incorporating some personal touches.

## Approach

I broke down the project into sections, first structuring the HTML, then styling with CSS. I aimed to closely match the design, focusing on layout, spacing, and typography. I also personalized the content, replacing placeholders with my own images and text.

## Challenges

- **Design Precision:** I worked to get as close to the original design as possible, even though pixel-perfect accuracy wasn't required.
- **Research:** I encountered a few new CSS properties and used online resources to implement them effectively.

## Conclusion

This project reinforced my HTML and CSS skills, teaching me how to tackle web design challenges and independently research solutions.
